# TransistorTester-source

**Extensions to the m-software to compile under Windows / Arduino for a TC1 clone with the original (broken) LGT8F328P replaced by a 328P.**

- Copy / overwrite the files in the root directory of the extracted m firmware.
- If you do not have a standard Arduino installation you must change the the path to Arduino directory in SetPath.cmd line 13 according to your configuration.
- Use the make*.cmd files for building and uploading.

You can find the last versions of the "m" firmware in the directory Markus
as compressed tar archives.
