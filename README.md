# TransistorTester-source

**Extensions to the m-software (v1.52m) to compile under Windows / Arduino for a TC1 clone with the original (broken) LGT8F328P replaced by a 328P.**

- Copy / overwrite the files in the root directory of the extracted m firmware.
- If you do not have a standard Arduino installation you must change the the path to Arduino directory in SetPath.cmd line 13 according to your configuration.
- Use the make*.cmd files for building and uploading.

You can find the last versions of the "m" firmware in the directory Markus
as compressed tar archives.

The latest version of the documentation can be found at
